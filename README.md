Sleep deprivation has become a major mental health crisis, especially among teenagers and college students, with some calling it a full-blown epidemic in younger populations. Causes of insufficient sleep vary from person to person, but what's undeniable is their impact on students: sleep deprivation can contribute to an inability to concentrate, poor grades, drowsy-driving incidents, anxiety, depression, thoughts of suicide and even suicide attempts.

While no one app can solve this crisis on its own, we hope that Slumberpup - a Tamagotchi-esque digital companion on the Android platform - will serve as a fun way to motivate college students to improve their sleeping habits. The Google FIT API (and its sleep data) are used to calculate a "sleep score" measuring one's quality of sleep each night. This sleep score directly influences the health and well-being of the user's pet, thus providing an incentive for the user to get better-quality sleep.
